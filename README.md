#READ ME
This repository is the home of the Diamond Shape app, a personal project from chiragmittal19. 

The app participated in the Hacktoberfest event to allow open source newbees to contribute a README file.

In this app the user can input an integer which results in a diamond shape to be drawn in text format.
